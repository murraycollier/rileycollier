Hello, I’m Riley Collier, a musician dedicated to crafting a unique sound within the new folk genre. My guitar-driven music draws inspiration from artists like Noah Kahan, whose ability to weave personal narratives into captivating melodies has profoundly influenced my own songwriting. Each composition reflects my experiences and emotions, exploring themes of love, introspection, and the beauty of life’s complexities. I strive to create a meaningful connection with my audience through my lyrics and melodies, inviting listeners to join me on a journey of shared experiences and emotions. I am excited to share my music with the world and look forward to connecting with you through my art.
